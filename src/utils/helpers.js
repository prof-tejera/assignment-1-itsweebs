// Add helpers here. This is usually code that is just JS and not React code. Example: write a function that
// calculates number of minutes when passed in seconds. Things of this nature that you don't want to copy/paste
// everywhere.

//format time in minutes and seconds
export const formatTime = (time) => { 
    const minutes = Math.floor(time / 60);
    const seconds = time % 60;
    return `${minutes}:${seconds < 10 ? '0' : ''}${seconds}`;
};
